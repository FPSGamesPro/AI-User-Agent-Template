# AI-User-Agent-Template
There are absolutely no viruses in this file, do not worry! (:

Instructions:
-----

Open the VBS first, which quickly runs Command Prompt to run the user agent.
If you have ran it, and are confused what to do when the HTML file is open,
then, in the "Enter URL (e.g. youtube.com)" placeholder, type a URL to get it.

If you run, and get an error, here is every bad error,
every other error should be good:
4xx: Client Errors (You Might Be Doing Something Wrong) 

The server understood the request but cannot process it due to an error on the user's end. 

400 Bad Request: Syntax error; the server can't understand what you want.
401 Unauthorized: You need to log in to see this content.
403 Forbidden: The server knows who you are but denies access to this specific resource.
404 Not Found: The page or file does not exist on the server.
408 Request Timeout: Your browser took too long to send the request.
429 Too Many Requests: You are hitting the server too fast; please slow down.
451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons: The content is blocked due to censorship or legal orders. 

5xx: Server Errors (The Website Broke) 

The request was valid, but the server failed to fulfill it. 

500 Internal Server Error: A generic "catch-all" error when something goes wrong on the server's backend.
502 Bad Gateway: One server on the internet got an invalid response from another server.
503 Service Unavailable: The server is overloaded or down for maintenance.
504 Gateway Timeout: The server acting as a bridge timed out waiting for the actual website server.
